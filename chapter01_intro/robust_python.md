# Robust Python

Robust code qualities:
  * Creates a healthy system that will last for years
  * Strongly constructed system with good foundations that can
    be built upon in the future
  * Capable of performing without failure, and when changes are introduced,
    vulnerabilities are **not**  

## Importance of Clean Code

This should be easy. You and other people have to work with the code you write.
The intents should be clear, functions should be short and simple, good naming
standards should be used, and there should be good documentation as well as 
self documenting code.

### Law of Least Surprise

Your code should behave in ways that is expected. People shouldn't read your code
and be surprised by the functionality.

### Intent

Your code is a communication tool. It is used to communicate with current and
future developers. Code and it's maintainers will change over time. The reasoning
and intent should be easily communicated for everyone who is to work on your code.

### Self Documenting Code

Code should be self-documenting by clearly expressing what it's doing, and it's intentions.
There should also be documentation to fill in gaps for developers as well.
